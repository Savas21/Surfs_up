 Analyzing hawai climate data with using Sql, Orm and Sqlalchemy

## Step 1 - Data Engineering

The climate data for Hawaii is provided through two CSV files. Start by using Python and Pandas to inspect the content of these files and clean the data.

* Create `data_engineering.ipynb` file and make Data Engineering tasks.

* Saved cleaned CSV files with the prefix `clean_`.

## Step 2 - Database Engineering

Use SQLAlchemy to model your table schemas and create a sqlite database for your tables. You will need one table for measurements and one for stations.

* Create a Jupyter Notebook called `database_engineering.ipynb` and use this to complete all of your Database Engineering work.

## Step 3 - Climate Analysis and Exploration

You are now ready to use Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration on your new weather station tables. All of the following analysis should be completed using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

* Create a Jupyter Notebook file called `climate_analysis.ipynb` and use it to complete your climate analysis and data exporation.

* Choose a start date and end date for your trip. Make sure that your vacation range is approximately 3-15 days total.

### Precipitation Analysis

* Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data.

### Station Analysis


### Temperature Analysis
